**Office for PHP** aim to be the first implementation of a cross-platform, reader/writer, dom-like based software to manage Office and OpenOffice documents with a pluggable back-end architecture that will let to developers to implement their own reader/writers and will let to users to manage their documents without be worried about the file format.

Main featurs of Office for PHP are:
- File Format Indipendent, this will let to add or remove support for a specific file format without the need to modify the front-end code of the library, pratically it works using a plugglable back-end architecture
- Cross-Platform, being written in PHP, and supported by phalanger, the library could be used in every kind of windows application using COM, COM+, .NET and PHP and over linux using MONO, when it will support corba, or PHP
- DOM-Like architecture, the front-end code will be like a tree where every branch will be a specific object that could contains other branches or leafs, like a Document Object Model
- BSD License, this will let to any developer to implement it without be worried about license

Naturally we ever looking for help in development, testing, documentation, packagers and so on.
